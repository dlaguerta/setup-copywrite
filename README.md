  uses: hashicorp/setup-copywrite@v1
  with:
    version: v0.1.2

    archive-checksum: 6b58be415b3e9b2f77d74f2cf70857819d15df512626658223b2d4a4f3adc404
```

## FAQ

- What checksum are we verifying?
  - After downloading the os/arch specific `tar` or `zip` archive that contains the copywrite binary, we compare its SHA256 hash against the user supplied `archive-checksum`
